Dr. Pearce is a cognitive neuroscientist and her research interests center on understanding on the reciprocal association between neurocognitive functioning and pediatric obesity. Dr. Pearce’s current research aims to: 1) characterize cognitive function, neural food-cue responsivity, and eating behaviors in children at high and low familial risk for obesity prior to the development of excess adiposity; 2) identify neurocognitive processes and eating behaviors that confer either risk or resiliency to pediatric obesity; and 3) characterize child eating behaviors through meal microstructure and computational modeling.\nazp271@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriana Ezray Wham is Research Data Librarian – STEM at the Penn State University Libraries. Dr. Wham conducts data management plan reviews and provides guidance, training, and consulting services for data management planning, active data management, reproducible research workflows using R, data visualization, data publication, as well as ORCiD integration and utility. She also works as one of the data curators for ScholarSphere, Penn State’s institutional repository. Prior to joining Penn State University Libraries, Briana received her Ph.D. in Entomology from Penn State, where she studied aspects of ecology, evolution, and conservation of bee communities.

    "text": "About the workshop\nBest practices in any field can be hard to implement, especially for people early in their career. And data management is often learned through trial and error. So what data management practices are both useful and “good enough” (Wilson et al., 2017) to have an impact on your work? What are the first steps you can take to make your data more FAIR (Wilkinson et al., 2016)? How can these practices improve your data lifecycle and/or pipeline (e.g., data use and re-use within and between labs)?\nThis workshop will provide a set of practices that can make data management and data sharing easier taught by local experts who have helped many researchers with related challenges.\nAlaina Pearce, Briana Wham, and Ana Enriquez will lead the workshop.\nMore details about the schedule and the faculty can be found by following the links."
